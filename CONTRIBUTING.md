# Formatting guidelines

All citation information should be entered using [Zotero](http://zotero.org/) or a similar tool. If you are already familiar with BibTeX (but haven't used Zotero), please read this [Quick Start Guide](http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/manual/BibDeskHelp_1.html#SEC5).  If you haven't used Zotero before, you should carefully read the [Zoter Quick Start Guide](https://www.zotero.org/support/quick_start_guide) for instructions on how to enter citation data.

*If you're not sure whether you're doing something correctly, please ask another community member for help!*
