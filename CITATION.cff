  The Block Foundation is dedicated to reshaping architectural practice and 
  housing systems through the innovative use of blockchain technology, has 
  generated a robust body of work, theoretical discussions, practical 
  explorations, and critical analyses. Our endeavor to create an equilibrium 
  in the real estate market and foster innovative architectural solutions has 
  sparked a diverse range of academic, technical, and professional 
  publications.
  This reference bibliography serves as a curated list of key texts and 
  resources that have informed our work and continues to guide our approach.
  The selection includes seminal writings on blockchain technology,
  architectural theory and practice, sustainable urban development, 
  digital economies, and decentralized market designs. It also encompasses 
  studies on the intersection of these areas, highlighting the 
  multidisciplinary and integrative nature of our work at the Block Foundation.
