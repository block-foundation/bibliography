	abstract = {A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

	abstract = {We propose a design for philanthropic or publicly funded seeding to allow (near) optimal provision of a decentralized, self-organizing ecosystem of public goods. The concept extends ideas from quadratic voting to a funding mechanism for endogenous community formation. Citizens make contributions to public goods of value to them. The amount received by the public good is (proportional to) the square of the sum of the square roots of contributions received. Under the “standard model,” this mechanism yields first best public goods provision. Variations can limit the cost, help protect against collusion, and aid coordination. We discuss applications to campaign finance and highlight directions for future analysis and experimentation.

The high degree of fragmentation and the reliance on financial institutions has pushed the physical and financial supply chains apart. The paper demonstrates how blockchain-based crypto assets address this limitation when used for conditioning payments on the flow of products. The integration of flows is contrasted in today’s supply chains and those using crypto assets for their payment settlement. The thesis is validated in two construction projects where a smart contract administered payments in crypto currencies and crypto tokens. The findings reveal that crypto assets can enhance both the granularity and the atomicity of the integration between the cash and product flows; the on- and off-chain realities can be directly linked in crypto asset-enabled supply chains. The paper concludes with a discussion of risks such as regulatory landscapes, security, and price volatility and offers potential solutions.},

A consortium blockchain system is designed to support construction quality management in which participants’ information permissions and lifecycle are discussed. Additionally, this study presents in detail the consensus process that aims to address the problem of information fraud. The automated compliance checking based on smart contracts is presented as well, aiming to assure that construction products meet regulation requirements. Finally, an example of the consortium blockchain network is visualized to validate the feasibility of blockchain-based construction quality information management.

Although there are numerous advantages, one of the key downsides of real estate investments is lack of liquidity. Thus, even though global real estate investments amount to about twice the size of investments in stock markets, the number of investors in the real estate market is significantly lower. Block chain technology has real potential in addressing the issues of liquidity and transparency, opening the market to even retail investors. Owing to the functionality and flexibility of creating Security Tokens, which are backed by real-world assets, real estate can be made liquid with the help of Special Purpose Vehicles. Tokens of ERC 777 standard, which represent fractional ownership of the real estate can be purchased by an investor and these tokens can also be listed on secondary exchanges. The robustness of Smart Contracts can enable the efficient transfer of tokens and seamless distribution of earnings amongst the investors.

This research hypothesizes that tokenizing the asset increases its price by improving the democracy of the market and its liquidity, and eventually results in a price bubble, although it is not clear how long it will last. Furthermore, this impact is hypothesized to be greater on the previously lesser-known assets, because of the dominant investor sentiment and valuation subjectivity.

Space tokenization is based on blockchain technology and security token offering (STO). Although some financial geographers noted the possible impact of blockchain technology on space financialization, it has not been examined in depth. Therefore, this paper demonstrates space tokenization cases in detail. Meridio and QuantmRE suggest financial structures that convert space into tokens based on fractional ownership transactions. QuantmRE, specifically, allows a homeowner to secure cash without either debt or ownership relinquishment through sales of tokenized home equity. As this method takes a form of sale transaction rather than a loan, it enables financial institutions to circumvent strengthened regulation on loans after the 2008 global financial crisis. Moreover, even “house poor” households, who own houses but lack cash due to excessive loans, can cash out from their properties through QuantmRE. As such, space tokenization enables financial institutions to overcome constrained conditions after the global financial crisis, thereby reproducing space financialization. Space tokenization also has the potential to geographically expand space financialization through stimulating investment in the depressed housing market.},

Our planet has been suffering from serious environmental problems and their social and political consequences. But imagine a vast new source of sustainable and renewable energy that would also bring more equitable economies. A previously untapped source of farming that could produce significant new sources of nutrition. Future societies where people could choose the communities they want to live in, free from the restrictions of conventional citizenship. This extraordinary vision of our near future as imagined in Seasteading attracted the powerful support of Silicon Valley's Peter Thiel—and it may be drawing close to reality. Facing growing environmental threats, French Polynesia has already signed on to build some of the world's first seasteads.

Joe Quirk and Patri Friedman show us how cities built on floating platforms in the ocean will work, and they profile some of the visionaries who are implementing basic concepts of seasteading today. An entrepreneur's dream, these floating cities will become laboratories for innovation and creativity. Seasteading "offers hope for a future when life on land has grown grim" (Kirkus Reviews), proving the adage that yesterday's science fiction is tomorrow's science fact.},

	abstract = {From an engineer and futurist, an impassioned account of technological stagnation since the 1970s and an imaginative blueprint for a richer, more abundant future. The science fiction of the 1960s promised us a future remade by technological innovation. We'd vacation in geodesic domes on Mars, have meaningful conversations with computers, and drop our children off at school in flying cars. Fast-forward 60 years, and we're still stuck in traffic in gas-guzzling sedans and boarding the same types of planes we flew in over half a century ago. What happened to the future we were promised? In Where Is My Flying Car?, J. Storrs Hall sets out to answer this deceptively simple question. What starts as an examination of the technical limitations of building flying cars evolves into an investigation of the scientific, technological, and social roots of the economic stagnation that started in the 1970s. From the failure to adopt nuclear energy and the suppression of cold fusion technology to the rise of a counterculture hostile to progress, Hall recounts how our collective ambitions for the future were derailed, with devastating consequences for global wealth creation and distribution. He then outlines a framework for a future powered by exponential progress-one in which we build as much in the world of atoms as we do in the world of bits, one rich in abundance and wonder. Drawing on years of original research and personal engineering experience, Where Is My Flying Car?, originally published in 2018, is an urgent, timely analysis of technological progress over the last 50 years and a bold vision for a better future.},

In The Mystery of Capital, the world-famous Peruvian economist takes up the question that, more than any other, is central to one of the most crucial problems the world faces today: Why do some countries succeed at capitalism while others fail?In strong opposition to the popular view that success is determined by cultural differences, de Soto finds that it actually has everything to do with the legal structure of property and property rights. Every developed nation in the world at one time went through the transformation from predominantly informal, extralegal ownership to a formal, unified legal property system. In the West we've forgotten that creating this system is also what allowed people everywhere to leverage property into wealth. This persuasive book will revolutionize our understanding of capital and point the way to a major transformation of the world economy.},

Nothing is more common, however, than for different political actors to see one another as bad sports. This essay explores, and distinguishes, three different reasons why conlict can occur. Players can disagree over how the game should best be played; over which game is being played; or over the degree to which settled rules are desirable in the irst place. In the irst case, arguments among players and spectators are more tractable than they seem, even salutary. In the second, they are less salutary but also less dangerous than commonly thought, due to modern polities’ ability to mix games and to adopt side constraints independent of the rules of any particular game. The third case is more dangerous but also an occupational hazard only of leaders, who must be brought to appreciate the virtues of settled rules and institutionalized roles on grounds that most ordinary citizens already recognize.},

Radical Markets turns this thinking on its head. With a new foreword by Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin and virtual reality pioneer Jaron Lanier as well as a new afterword by Eric Posner and Glen Weyl, this provocative book reveals bold new ways to organize markets for the good of everyone. It shows how the emancipatory force of genuinely open, free, and competitive markets can reawaken the dormant nineteenth-century spirit of liberal reform and lead to greater equality, prosperity, and cooperation. Only by radically expanding the scope of markets can we reduce inequality, restore robust economic growth, and resolve political conflicts. But to do that, we must replace our most sacred institutions with truly free and open competition Radical Markets shows how},
